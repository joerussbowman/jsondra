Jsondra is an http and json interface for the Cassandra project.

It is written in python using the Tornado framework released by Facebook,
and uses the Lazyboy project as released by Digg for interacting with Cassandra.

Jsondra uses HTTP verbage to interact with Cassandra.

HTTP GET will get an item.
HTTP POST/PUT will store an item.
HTTP DELETE will delete an item.

Currently, Jsondra only supports basic get/put(or post)/delete operations. You
can create an item, access an item by it's key, or delete an item by it's key.

More functionality will come in the future.

Items accessed by supplying the Key object via the url: ie:
    http://localhost:8001/keyspace/columnfamily/key/

Responses from the server are either HTTP status codes, or JSON formatted
values. Jsondra does not store raw JSON within Cassandra. It uses Tornado
and Lazyboy to parse the JSON an store items as columns within Cassandra.

Included is a sample client written using node.js. It's still very much a work
in progress.
